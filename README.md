Code Test

Technology
   I have built the requirement on Swagger, OpenAPI, SpringBoot and Java 11.
   IDE Eclipse (Version: 2018-12 (4.10.0)
                Build id: 20181214-0600).
                
Important design features
    1) API Spec driven development - Generate code based on Swagger YAML file
    2) Versioning of the API.
    

Business:
   Implement character count in a list of words. I have implement the GET method and pass two parameters
   1. words (list of words)
   2. match (character)
   
   I have find the number of match character in all the words and spit out the output.

Business Process
  1) 
  2) At the startup data has been loaded into the app

Project Structure
   Controller package - Controller class to register webservice end points (consumes and produce in JSON)
   Model package - model class POJOs (generated by openapi
   Service package - Business logic layer.
   Exception package - Contains exception classes.
   Test package - All test classes 

Test:
 Classes are written at
 1) Service level (unit)

  
Future Improvements
 1) Integration tests are not provided 
 2) Unit test for controller needs to be completed as well. 
 3) More test case will be written to have a better coverage.
 4) Profile can be implemented to make the same application runs in different environments.
